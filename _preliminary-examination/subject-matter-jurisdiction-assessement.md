An alleged crime&nbsp;<u>must</u>&nbsp;be either a war crime, a crime against humanity, or genocide, as defined in the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf). If the alleged crime does not fall within one of these definitions, the case cannot move forward at the ICC.
