Whether alleged atrocities are referred to the Prosecutor, or she uses her *proprio motu* power, a case always begins with what is called a “preliminary examination”. Each preliminary examination has four phases of analysis: initial, jurisdictional, admissibility, and interest of justice. &nbsp;

The Prosecutor may move to a formal investigation if all four of these requirements are satisfied.
