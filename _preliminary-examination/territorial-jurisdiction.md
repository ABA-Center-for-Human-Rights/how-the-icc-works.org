The ICC can *only&nbsp;*exercise jurisdiction in the territory of [State Parties](https://www.aba-icc.org/about-the-icc/states-parties-to-the-icc/), non-State Parties that consent to jurisdiction, or non-State Parties that are referred to the Court by the UN Security Council. If the alleged crimes occurred on a State that does not meet these requirements, the case cannot move forward at the ICC.&nbsp;
