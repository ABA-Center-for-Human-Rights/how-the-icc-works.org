If convicted, the Trial Chamber (TC) will determine the appropriate sentence by considering a range of factors, such as the gravity of the crimes and the convicted personâ€™s role in the crimes.

The death penalty is not an option. The TC can impose up to 30 years of imprisonment or a life imprisonment. The TC can also issue fines and/or forfeiture of proceeds, property, or assets derived directly or indirectly from the crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If the sentence and/or other punishment issued by the TC is appealed by the Office of the Prosecutor or the convicted person, the Appeals Chamber has the power to uphold, reverse, or amend the sentence and/or other punishment issued.
