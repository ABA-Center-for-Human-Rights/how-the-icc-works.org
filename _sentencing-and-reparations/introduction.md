If convicted, the Trial Chambers (TC) will determine the appropriate sentence by considering a range of factors, such as the gravity of the crimes and the convicted personâ€™s role in the crimes.

With the death penalty not an option, the TC can impose up to 30 years of imprisonment or a life imprisonment. The TC can also issue fines and/or forfeiture of proceeds, property, or assets derived directly or indirectly from the crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If the sentence and/or other punishment issued by the TC is appealed by the Office of the Prosecutor, convicted person, and/or the Victims, the Appeals Chambers has the power to uphold, reverse, or amend the sentence and/or other punishment issued.
