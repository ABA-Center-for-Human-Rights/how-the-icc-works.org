An **arrest warrant** can be issued if believes that the arrest of the person is necessary to ensure that the person appears at trial. It can also be issued if the judges think it is necessary to ensure that the person does not obstruct the investigation, or to prevent the person from continuing to commit crimes similar to those he or she is suspected of.
