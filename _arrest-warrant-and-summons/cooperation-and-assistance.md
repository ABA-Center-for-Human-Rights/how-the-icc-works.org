Carrying out an arrest warrant depends on the cooperation of the country where the fugitive is located, and of its police force. The ICC has no police force of its own.

The case of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir illustrates the problem. Two arrest warrants, for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide, have been issued by the ICC. But President al-Bashir is still at large. While he has reduced the number of countries he has travelled to, he has nevertheless continued to travel to many countries, including ICC States Parties that have not arrested him. He remains at large, and his trial will not occur until Sudan or another country is willing to arrest and transfer him to the ICC.

The Court, despite continuing difficulties, has also seen successful cooperation from States Parties. On May 23, 2008, the Pre-Trial Chamber issued an arrest warrant for Jean-Pierre Bemba. Following his arrest a day later, on July 1, 2008, a Belgian court ruled that Bemba should be sent to the ICC. The order was executed and Bemba made his initial appearance before the Court on July 4, 2008.

The Court has also received cooperation from countries that are not member states. In March 2013, for example, the USA and Rwanda cooperated to transfer to The Hague a person (Bosco Ntaganda) who was subject to an ICC arrest warrant. Ntaganda had handed himself in to the U.S. embassy in Rwanda. Neither Rwanda nor the USA are ICC States Parties.
