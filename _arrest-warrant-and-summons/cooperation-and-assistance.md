Carrying out an arrest warrant depends on the cooperation of the country where the fugitive is located, and of its police force. The ICC has no police force of its own.

The case of [Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-al-bashir/) illustrates a problem that the ICC continually faces. Two arrest warrants for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and/or genocide have been issued by the ICC. However, President al-Bashir is still at large. While the arrest warrants have reduced the number of countries he can safely travel to, he nevertheless continues to travel to many countries including ICC States Parties without being arrested. Al-Bashir's trial will not occur until Sudan or another country is willing to arrest and transfer him to the ICC.

The Court, despite continuing difficulties, has also seen successful cooperation from States Parties. On May 23, 2008, the Pre-Trial Chamber issued an arrest warrant for [Jean-Pierre Bemba](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/)&nbsp;of the Central African Republic. Following his arrest a day later on July 1, 2008, a Belgian court ruled that Bemba should be sent to the ICC. The Belgian court order was executed and Bemba made his initial appearance before the ICC on July 4, 2008.

The ICC has also received cooperation from countries that are not member states. In March 2013, for example, the USA and Rwanda cooperated to transfer [Bosco Ntaganda](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-ntaganda/)&nbsp;of the Democratic Republic of Congo to The Hague. Ntaganda was subject to an ICC arrest warrant and had turned himself into the U.S. embassy in Rwanda. Neither Rwanda nor the USA are ICC States Parties.
