title: 2013 Comoros Referral
---
In May 2010, during Israel’s naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, the Free Gaza Movement sent an eight-boat flotilla of ships called the “Gaza Freedom Flotilla” to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinians.  The flotilla of ships departed from Turkey and was intended to reach Gaza, and the ships were registered to various countries including State Parties Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia.  The Israeli Defense Forces boarded the ships to enforce Israel’s blockade, and the interception led to civilian deaths.  In May 2013, Comoros, a State Party, exercised its right to make a referral of itself to the ICC on the basis that alleged atrocity crimes had been committed upon its territory, and the ICC Office of the Prosecutor opened a preliminary examination.
