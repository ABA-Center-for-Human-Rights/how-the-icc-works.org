The Trial Chamber (TC) is required to conduct a fair and expeditious trial that protects the rights of the Accused, Victims, witnesses, and others involved. There is a presumption that trial sessions will be open to the public. The trial can take place in “closed session” where this is necessary to protect witnesses or the confidentiality of sensitive matters.

The first step of a trial is to allow the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) to present its evidence in order to prove the Accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense lawyers are allowed to test the strength of the OTP evidence presented.&nbsp;

Once the OTP’s case is concluded, the Defense can present their own evidence. The OTP is allowed to test the strength of the Defense evidence.

Victims are allowed to testify at trial. They can testify as witnesses called by the OTP, and can also testify independently of the OTP. Representatives of victims are allowed to submit evidence to support, or to demonstrate the unreliability of, evidence presented by the OTP and the Defense. Representatives of victims are also allowed to make written and oral observations when the TC allows them to do so.

Once the trial is complete, the TC will begin to deliberate in private and reach a guilty or not guilty verdict. The TC delivers its verdict with written justifications.
