The Trial Chamber (TC) is required to conduct a fair and expeditious trial that protects the rights of the Accused, Victims, witnesses, and others involved. All trials are public with the exception of “closed sessions” done to protect vulnerable witnesses and the confidentiality of sensitive matters.

The first step of a trial is to allow the Office of the Prosecutor to present its evidence in order to prove the Accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Defense and Victims are allowed to test the strength of the OTP evidence presented and/or support with additional evidence.

Once the OTP’s case is concluded, the second step of the trial is for the Accused and his/her defense team can present their own evidence. The OTP and Victims are allowed to test the strength of the Defense evidence as well.

The last step, once the trial is complete, is for the TC to deliberate in private, and reach a guilty or not guilty verdict. The TC delivers their verdict with written justifications, called a “judgment.”
