Victims can participate during almost every stage of the ICC judicial process. Under the Rome Statute, victims have the right to be represented by legal counsel, to have protective measures, to receive notifications of hearings, and have their views and concerns raised during proceedings. For example:

* During the pretrial period, victims can file written submissions to the judges and make oral submissions on any matters which affect their interests.
* During trial, victims may submit evidence, ask questions of witnesses including the Accused, and appear in person to testify.
* After a conviction, victims can appeal a decision on reparation.
