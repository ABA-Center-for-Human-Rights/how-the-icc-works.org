The Office of the Prosecutor or the Accused can appeal a judgment to the Appeals Chamber. In an appeal, the Appeals Chamber will:

* review the judgment for errors of law, procedures, and/or fact; and
* hold public hearings to listen to arguments from the parties.

After deliberations in private, the AC will issue its own judgment that either:

* affirms some or all of the Trial Chamber’s judgment;
* reverses or amends some or all of the Trial Chamber's judgment; or
* orders a new trial with a different Trial Chamber.

The Prosecutor – but not the victims – can appeal an acquittal. If the accused is convicted, the Trial Chamber can order that the accused pay reparations to the victims. The victims can appeal an order for reparations.
