Whether *after* or *during* the commission of alleged atrocity crimes, the ICC can *only&nbsp;*exercise jurisdiction over such crimes in one of three ways:

* Where the UN Security Council refers the crimes to the Court, or
* Where the ICC Prosecutor initiates a preliminary examination into the crimes.
