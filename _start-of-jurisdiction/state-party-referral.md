A [State Party](https://www.aba-icc.org/about-the-icc/states-parties-to-the-icc/) referral is when any country that has ratified the Rome Statute (making them a State Party) refers alleged atrocity crimes to the ICC Prosecutor. The atrocities must have been committed:

* on the territory of the State Party that makes the referral or on the territory of another State Party; or
* by a national from the referring State Party or another State Party.

Most ICC cases have arisen where a State Party has referred alleged atrocity crimes to the ICC Prosecutor that have been committed on its own territory. This is sometimes called a "self-referral", and includes the ICC investigations into crimes in the [Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://www.aba-icc.org/country/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/), [Uganda](https://www.aba-icc.org/country/uganda/), the [Central African Republic](https://www.aba-icc.org/country/central-african-republic/) (twice self-referred), [Mali](https://www.aba-icc.org/country/mali/), and [Gabon](https://www.aba-icc.org/country/gabon/).
