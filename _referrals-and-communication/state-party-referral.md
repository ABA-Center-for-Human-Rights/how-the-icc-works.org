A State Party referral is when any ICC State Party, or member state, refers alleged atrocities to the Prosecutor that have either:

* occurred on its territory or the territory of another State Party

OR

* by one of its nationals or a national from another State Party

Most cases at the ICC came from State Party referrals.
