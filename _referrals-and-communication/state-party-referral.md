A State Party referral is when any country that has ratified the Rome Statute (making them a State Party) refers alleged atrocity crimes to the ICC Prosecutor. The atrocities must have been committed:

* on the territory of the State Party that makes the referral or on the territory of another State Party; or
* by a national from the referring State Party or another State Party.

Most ICC cases have arisen where a State Party has referred alleged atrocity crimes to the ICC Prosecutor that have been committed on its own territory. This is sometimes called a "self-referral", and includes the ICC investigations into crimes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, the Central African Republic, Mali, and Gabon.
