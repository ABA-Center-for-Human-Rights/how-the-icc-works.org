A State Party referral is when any country that has signed and ratified the ICC Statute refers alleged atrocities to the Prosecutor. The atrocities must have been committed:

* on the territory of the State Party that makes the referral or on the territory of another State Party; or
* by a national from the referring State Party or another State Party.

Most cases at the ICC have arisen where a State Party has referred to the ICC atrocities that have been committed on its own territory. This is sometimes called a "self-referral".
