The ICC [Office of the Prosecutor](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/otp) (OTP) may turn a preliminary examination into a formal investigation called a situation (such as the situation in [Libya](){: .cc-active}) if the four phases of analysis in a preliminary examination are satisfied.

In an investigation, the OTP gathers as much information as possible to uncover the truth about the alleged crime, as well as to determine who is most responsible. An investigation may include:

* Inspection where the alleged crime occurred;
* Collection of evidence like cellphone data, emails, radio intercepts, videos, photographs, minutes of meetings, military and police communications, speeches and forensic material such as exhumation reports;
* Interviewing witnesses and victims;
* Consultation with relevant experts and specialists;
* Analysis of financial transactions.

The OTP is legally required to take whatever steps are necessary to gather all evidence which is relevant to an alleged crime, including incriminating and exonerating evidence. Before trial starts, the Prosecutor must disclose a great deal of evidence to the Defense. This includes all the evidence the Prosecutor intends to rely upon at trial, and any evidence which tends to show the innocence of the accused or which affects the credibility of prosecution evidence.
