The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the world’s only permanent international court with a mandate to investigate and prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. These three sets of crimes — collectively called “atrocity crimes”— &nbsp;have many overlapping characteristics. A criminal act, such as the murder of a group of villagers, could be characterized as genocide, a crime against humanity, a war crime, or all three. How a crime is characterized often depends on the intent of the offender and the context in which the crime took place.
