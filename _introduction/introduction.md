The ICC is the world’s only permanent tribunal with a mandate to investigate and prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. These three sets of crimes — sometimes called “atrocity crimes”— &nbsp;have many overlapping characteristics. A criminal act, such as the murder of a group of villagers, could be characterised as genocide, a crime against humanity, or a war crime. How a crime is characterised depends on the intent of the offender, and the circumstances in which the crime takes place.&nbsp;
