The ICC is the world’s only permanent tribunal with a mandate to investigate and prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. These three sets of crimes — often called “atrocity crimes”—  have many overlapping characteristics. A criminal act, such as the murder of a group of villagers, could be characterised as genocide, a crime against humanity, a war crime, or as all three. How a crime is characterised depends on the intent of the offender, and the circumstances in which the crime took place.
