War crimes are criminal acts committed when there is an armed conflict: a resort to armed force between states. They can also be committed in a civil war. The criminal act must be related to the armed conflict, so a murder or a theft during a war is not necessarily a “war crime”. A war crime can be many different things, from illegal seizure of property to murder.
