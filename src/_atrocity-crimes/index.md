The ICC is the world’s only permanent tribunal with a mandate to investigate and prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, which are collectively called “atrocity crimes”. While these crimes have many overlapping characteristics - as a criminal act could be one, two, or all three of them -  the three atrocity crimes are distinct. There is also no hierarchy among the three atrocity crimes. One crime is not graver than another.
