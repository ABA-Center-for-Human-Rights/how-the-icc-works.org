Even when the temporal, subject matter, and personal jurisdictional requirements are satisfied, the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf) limits the types of cases that “admissible” at the ICC. So, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor must determine whether or not another court (domestic or another international court) is properly investigating and prosecuting the alleged crimes (called “complementarity”), and whether the alleged crimes are the gravest of crimes.
