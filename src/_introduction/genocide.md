Genocide is criminal acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, and such acts include killing or imposing measures to prevent births, for instance. Unlike CAH or War Crimes, Genocide does not require a particular context to be happening simultaneously. However, like CAH, Genocide can happen during war or peace.
