A State Party referral is when any ICC State Party, or member state, refers alleged atrocities to the Prosecutor that have either:

* occurred on its territory or the territory of another State Party
* <u>or</u>

  by one of its nationals or a national from another State Party


Most cases at the ICC came from State Party referrals. &nbsp;&nbsp;

On July 13, 2000, the Malian Minister of Justice, Malick Coulibaly, wrote a [letter](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/ICCReferralLetterMali130712_02.pdf) to the Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, referring the situation in Mali to the ICC.
