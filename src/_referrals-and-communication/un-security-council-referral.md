The UN Security Council may refer alleged atrocities in any country to the Prosecutor by passing a resolution authorized by the UN Charter.

In February 2011, the UN Security Council adopted [Resolution 1970](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/081A9013-B03D-4859-9D61-5D0B0F2F5EFA/0/1970Eng.pdf), referring the situation in Libya (a non-State Party) to the ICC.
