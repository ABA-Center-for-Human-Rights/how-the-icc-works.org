Victims can have a role during every stage of the ICC judicial process. Under the Rome Statute, victims have the right to be represented by legal counsel, to have operational and procedural protective measures, to receive notifications of hearings, and have their views and concerns raised during proceedings, including:

* During pretrial, victims can file written motions and make oral submissions.
* During trial, victims may submit evidence, ask questions of witnesses including the Accused, and appear in person.
* During appeals, victims can appeal decisions on reparations after conviction.
