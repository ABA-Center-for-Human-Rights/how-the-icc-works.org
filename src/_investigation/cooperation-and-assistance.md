The ICC cannot act unilaterally because:

* It does not have its own police force or independent enforcement powers
* It cannot enter or obtain evidence in sovereign countries without the country’s permission.


As a result, the ICC depends on the “cooperation and assistance” of countries in order to facilitate investigations and prosecutions. Cooperation and assistance may include:

* Allowing access to documents and other evidence;
* Tasking domestic personnel to assist the OTP
* Helping locate witnesses and victims; and
* Assisting in the identification of crime sites
