After an individual’s initial appearance, the Pre-Trial Chamber ("PTC") must hold a hearing within a reasonable amount of time to confirm or dismiss the charges presented by the Prosecutor. The PTC can either:

**1) Confirm the charges and send the case to the Trial Chambers for trial (at this point the individual becomes the “Accused”); or**

**2) Dismiss the charges and set the individual free; or**

**3) Pause the hearing to request the Prosecutor to produce additional evidence or change the charges with the evidence presented.**

If charges are dismissed, the Prosecutor can provide additional evidence at a later time in order to convince the PTC to confirm the original charges. &nbsp;Alternatively, the Prosecutor can start the whole process over again with different charges.
